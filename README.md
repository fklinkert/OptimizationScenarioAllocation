# OptimizationScenarioAllocation

hw3index.csv: contains daily prices for assets in the russell 1000

HW4_Part1.py: checks that the dstribution of assets follows a normal distribution

main.cpp: performs moving averages as a simulation method in asset prices to create a scenario. Uses Gurobi to determine the weight allocation of the simulated scenario to determine asset allocation. Ideally multiple scenarios would be conducted to determine an asset allocation that provides positive returns in all scenario to determine an arbitrage.
